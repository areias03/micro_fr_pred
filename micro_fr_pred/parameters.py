    This parameter is defined as the sum of all import and export fluxes
    multiplied by their repective metabolite's Metabolite Exchange Score (MES).
    It represents the harmonic mean of all fluxes for a single taxon. A negative
    value indicates that the taxon consumes more impactful metabolites than what
    it produces. A positive value indicates higher rates of production of impactful
    metabolites to the whole community.
